The pkg.go.dev site renders the examples with their actual markdown table inputs and outputs, providing a clear demonstration of how the `example` package processes tabular data.

Each example in this directory corresponds to a live example on pkg.go.dev. Explore the subdirectories to see the implementation details, and refer to the pkg.go.dev link above to see the examples with their markdown inputs and outputs.
